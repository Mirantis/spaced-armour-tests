Spaced Armour tests
-------------------

Stepler is intended to provide the community with a testing framework that is
capable of perform advanced scenario and destructive test cases, like batch
instances launching, instances migration, services restarts and different
HA-specific cases.

This solution is not intended for OpenStack API validation, but provides simple
tool for creation tests to check advanced end-user scenarios.
